## User Experience (UX) <a name="UX"></a>
### Project Goals <a name="project-goals"></a>

 * Create a activity tracker for indoor climbing

 * Have users log climbs, collect this information and store it in a database

 * Retreive this information and display it in a variety of graphical representations, to allow users to guide future training/ activities.

 * Responsive design so it can be used across different devices

 * Have clear instructions and user interface

 * Initially focussed on a single user but I would like to eventually intergrate authentication add a feature for mutliple users to log in with a user name and password

### User stories <a name="user-stories"></a>

A user of the site wants to:

* Keep a log of their climbing sessions

* The logs to contain the different climbs they did in that session

* Information on difficulty, length name and whether they completed the climb to be stored

* To be able to visualise the data about the sessions and climbs in visually pleasing graphs and charts

* To be able to use this information to guide there future activities

### Database schema <a name="database-schema"></a>

[Figma](www.figma.com) was used to create a database schema and wireframes for the project. This ensured I had a clear vision for the project before beginning to write code.
